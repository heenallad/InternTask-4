Today's Task was to enhance the existing html page by adding mobile-friendly layout using media queries.
I redesigned the already existing index.html and did the font size smaller.
The side navbar is adjustable i.e. can be slide inside & drag outside.
I had provided the screenshots of before & after application of css.
